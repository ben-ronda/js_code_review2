## Installation:
To install FoodTracker, clone the following repository by:
1. Open up your terminal and type the following line: `git clone https://github.com/ben-ronda/js_code_review2.git`  
2. Use this line to change directories to the project folder: `cd js_code_review2`  
3. Then use this to install the remaining developer dependencies: `sudo npm install` (note: to use npm you must have node.js installed)  
4. Then install the bower dependencies with `sudo bower install`  
5. Now that we have installed bower, run: `bower install bootstrap --save`
